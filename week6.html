        <p>There is a bug I identified the source but wasn't able to fix, where if jumping from a high platform the character goes through the floor.</p>
        <p>The second problem is that the physics go according to the framerate, making it slow on low power. A solution would be to use the function millis() and base it off of the time, which I won't be implementing on this project.</p>
